# Scripts for the Genome Assembly and Annotation Courses

The scripts are divided into assembly and annotation. Scripts are numbered according to their order of execution (with the assembly scripts preceding the ones for the annotation part). R scripts which where run locally and not on the cluster are indicated as XX.1, XX.2 etc., where XX refers to the number of the last step performed on the cluster.
